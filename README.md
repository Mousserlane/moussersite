## The Playground
A Playground that I'm using for Proof of Concept. But it can also be use as boilerplate.
It's a Universal React App which include server side rendering.

## Under The Hood
   - reactjs
   - react-redux
   - webpack
   - expressjs
   - bootstrap-sass
   - react-bootstrap
   - react-router 4
